# Assignment 2

## The importance of following predefined standards ensures that the code/text is easy to read and can be understood by everyone that has access to the working directory, also documenting/commenting is a great way to show what was done to the code. Naming conventions is important as it makes the variables, functions and more, easy to read and easy to find.

## A software developer can use these habits for the benefit of themself and their colleagues.

## This repository includes the work for assignment 2. The contents of the files include my learning experience on simple data types and how to show them, how to perform mathematical operations, and how to declare and use collection types including, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
